# Cigarette Smokers' Problem

In this project, we try to explore the classical synchronisation problem. Our objectives of the project are as follows.

- Understand the issues with a naive solution
- Create a solution with a novel semaphore implemented by ourselves
- Generalise the problem for an arbitary number of smokers
- Propose a solution for the generalised problem using semaphore arrays and bitmasking
- Use monitor to solve the problem
- Provide a comparative analysis of the different solutions

The repository contains source code for all different solutions proposed.
